= Redox Keyboard

This repository contains information for configuring, compiling and flashing the QMK firmware for the Redox Keyboard.

== Setup

. Clone this repository and change into the root directory.
. Initialize the submodules with `git submodule init`.
. Link the keymap with `ln -s $(pwd)/kbredemeier $(pwd)/qmk_firmware/keyboards/redox/keymaps/kbredemeier`.

=== Nix/Nixos

. Make sure you are a member of the `dialout`.
  This is required for writing to the serial port.
. Run `nix-shell` from the `qmk_firmware` directory.
  This sets up the build environment for the firmware and puts the `qmk` command into the `PATH`.
. (Only on the first time) Run `qmk setup`.
. (Only on the first time) Run `qmk config user.keyboard=redox/rev1`.
. (Only on the first time) Run `qmk config user.keymap=kbredemeier`.

== Importing a configuration export

The https://config.qmk.fm/#/redox/rev1/LAYOUT[QMK configurator] allows to export the keymap as a json file. 

. Downloaded the json export from the configurator.
. Copy the file to `qmk_firmware/keyboards/redox/keymaps/kbredemeier/qmk_configurator_export.json`.
. Change the directory to `qmk_firmware/keyboards/redox/keymaps/kbredemeier`.
. Run `qmk json2c -o keymap.c qmk_configurator_export.json`.

== Compile and flash the firmware

. Change the directory to `qmk_firmware/keyboards/redox/keymaps/kbredemeier`.
. Compile the firmware with `qmk compile`.
. Flash the firmware with `qmk flash`.
. Hit both `Shift` keys an `B` on the keyboard.
  Alternatively press the reset button on the bottom of the keyboard.
. Repeat the last two steps with the other half of the keyboard plugged in.
